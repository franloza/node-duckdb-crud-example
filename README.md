# Simple Node+DuckDB CRUD API 
This project demostrates how you can use the [DuckDB Node.js Client ](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/nodejs/overview) to connect to DuckDB.

Special thanks to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) who wrote the ~90% of this code üôè.

## Installation notes
I had to use `npm install duckdb --build-from-resource` to install `duckdb` dependency.
